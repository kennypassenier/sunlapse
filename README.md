# sunlapse
sunlapse script
This script scrapes the sunrise and sunset data from a certain website.
Then it starts and stops the timelapse according to the data.
Very rough around the edges, for instance, it overwrites your images when you start a new project.
Currently not working, the site that it uses to scrape data has changed its layout.
